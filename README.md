# Cryptocurrency Analysis

Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Analysis repository! This repository contains an exploratory analysis of cryptocurrency prices using Python. The analysis focuses on three prominent cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether.

## Overview

Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years as alternative investments and digital assets. Understanding the trends and patterns in cryptocurrency prices is crucial for investors and traders to make informed decisions.

In this repository, we explore historical cryptocurrency price data obtained from the CoinGecko API. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate daily returns, visualize price trends, compute moving averages, analyze volatility, and explore correlations between different cryptocurrencies.

## Contents

- **Data Collection**: Obtaining historical price data from the CoinGecko API.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing price trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Daily Returns**: Calculating and visualizing daily returns for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether.
- **Moving Averages**: Computing and visualizing moving averages to identify trends and support/resistance levels.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Measuring and comparing the volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether prices.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring the correlation between the prices of different cryptocurrencies.
- **Future Work**: Discussing potential avenues for further model development, validation, and deployment for real-time forecasting of cryptocurrency prices.
